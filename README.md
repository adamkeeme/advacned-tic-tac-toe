<h3>Classic & Ultimate Tic Tac Toe with AIs (Easy/Medium/Hard)</h3>


To start the game, simply run the "ultimate_ttt_gui.py" script. No python packages needed as far as you are on Python=3.9 

Then Alt-Tab to the game window (sorry, I couldn't figure out how to make the window pop like it normally should)


The [rules]([url](https://store.steampowered.com/app/360870/Ultimate_TicTacToe/)) for ultimate tic-tac-toe:

- When the game starts, the player with the X piece will move first, and can place his piece wherever he wants. To let the opponent (AI or friend) place the first piece, you can choose to play with O. Placing the first piece will not give the player such a big advantage as in the classic tic-tac-toe game, he still needs to create a strategy in order to defeat you.
- Next, your opponent will have to play the board respective to the square that you've just filled.
- Your next move will be in a board that your opponent sends you to, given by the square that he just made his move on.
- What happens if the opponent sends you to an already won or draw board? Then you can go wherever you like, but be sure not to send your opponent to a closed board, because he would have the same advantage.
- After playing a little, you will see that, even though you could win a small board easily, the fact that if the move you make would put your opponent at an advantage, you could chose to not win that board at the time, or perhaps forfeit it, if it will give you an advantage to complete other 3 boards in a row and win the match.
